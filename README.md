# Users List App

This is a simple React app that fetches a list of users from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and displays their information. It includes a search feature to filter users by their name.

## Features
- Fetches user data from the JSONPlaceholder API.
- Displays user name, email, and website.
- Search functionality to filter users by name.
- Displays loading and error states.
- If no users match the search query, a message will be shown indicating no results.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Styling the app with a separate stylesheet (`App.css`).

## Installation

To run the app locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahulsharma998/brain-cell.git
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd users-list-app
```
Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```
How It Works
On initial load, the app fetches a list of users from the API.
The data is stored in a state (users), and the app shows a loading message until the data is successfully fetched.
A search bar allows users to filter the displayed list by name.
If no matching results are found, a "No users found" message is displayed.
Error Handling
If the API request fails, an error message will be displayed.
If the app is loading, a loading message will be shown.
